# Mini Game Server/Client System

This project is a clone of a group project undertaken by class of 2023 in the University of New England's unit [COSC220: Software Development Studio 2](https://handbook.une.edu.au/units/2023/COSC220?year=2023).
Commit details for all contributors have been anonymised, except for my own ([vekp](https://github.com/vekp)) and the unit coordinator's ([wbillingsley](https://github.com/wbillingsley))

In this project, the class was broken up into teams of four, and we were provided with a minigame server/client framework, in which each team was to develop a feature/s of their choosing.

My team, the Intelligits, chose to develop a framework to allow game developers to create unlockable achievements, keep track of their locked/unlocked status for each user, and allow the user to view the achievements. We also developed a single/multiplayer version of Battleship in order to showcase the achievement framework.

My main responsibility within the team was developing the client side UI for users to view achievements. This included developing a fully independent animated popup notification system, which was used to notify players when they had unlocked achievements, and was also used by other teams to display game elements, messages, and dialog boxes.

I also assisted in establishing a client/server route for communication of achievement data, added several cosmetic features to Battleship, created all unit tests for Battleship and the UI, and helped other teams implement our achievement and popup frameworks into their own features.
